## Projects üíª

### [1. Stock Volatility Forecasting System](https://github.com/Obika-Franklin/StockAnalysisAPI) üìà

**Problem:** Financial markets demand tools for risk assessment and informed decision-making.

**Solution:** Developed a comprehensive system for predicting stock volatility. This project utilizes a **GARCH model** for forecasting, powered by a **FastAPI** backend for model training and prediction. The system integrates **Alpha Vantage API** for real-time data, stores historical data in **SQLite**, and provides model persistence with `joblib`. A user-friendly web interface built with **Plotly Dash** enables interactive analysis and real-time use.

**Impact:** Provides valuable insights for investors, supports risk management strategies, and can be integrated into automated trading systems.

### 2. Impact of Reminder Emails on Admissions Exam Completion Rates (A/B Testing) üìß

**Problem:** Low conversion of user registrations to exam completions in online learning platforms.

**Solution:** Conducted a controlled **A/B test** using synthetic data to evaluate the effectiveness of reminder emails on admissions exam completion rates. The analysis is presented through an interactive web application built with **Plotly Dash**, allowing stakeholders to visualize key metrics and understand the impact of behavioral nudges.

**Impact:** Delivers data-driven insights to enhance user engagement and improve conversion rates in digital education platforms.

### 3. Understanding Credit Insecurity: A Data-Driven Segmentation of American Households üìä

**Problem:** Identifying and understanding households facing credit insecurity.

**Solution:** Applied unsupervised machine learning (**K-Means Clustering**) to the 2022 U.S. Federal Reserve's **Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF)** data. Used **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction to identify distinct segments of credit-constrained households. The insights are presented through a dynamic web-based dashboard developed with **Plotly Dash**.

**Impact:** Provides valuable insights for marketing, public policy, and financial services to better understand and address credit insecurity.

### 4. Predicting Structural Damage Post-Earthquake in Kavrepalanchok, Nepal üèòÔ∏èüåç

**Problem:** The critical need to predict building damage from earthquakes for proactive disaster preparedness.

**Solution:** Developed a predictive model to identify buildings prone to severe damage *before* an earthquake. This project involved collecting detailed building characteristics into a **SQLite database**. Overcame dataset imbalance using **SMOTE** and **Random Undersampling** techniques, and trained a tuned **Random Forest classifier** for improved accuracy in identifying vulnerable structures.

**Impact:** Enables proactive reinforcement and targeted aid distribution, significantly enhancing community resilience in earthquake-prone regions.

### 5. STOCK ANALYSIS CHATBOT üí¨

**Problem:** Navigating the complexities of stock market information can be challenging for many.

**Solution:** Built an intelligent stock analysis chatbot designed to make market insights accessible and understandable. This Python project fetches real-time or historical stock data using the **Alpha Vantage API**, analyzes trends, and calculates technical indicators (e.g., SMA, RSI). Analyzed data is stored and retrieved from a **ChromaDB** instance, enabling **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide contextually relevant answers using a **Gemini language model**. The chatbot handles queries for single or multiple stocks and includes an evaluation mechanism for response quality.

**Impact:** Empowers users, regardless of technical expertise, to gain insights into stock market trends and key indicators through natural language interaction.
